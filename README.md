# Movie-Mania



Build a simple application using Flutter compatible with Android/iOS devices.

- Build a simple aesthetic app to add/edit/delete/list movies that a user has watched.
- Show an infinite scrollable listview containing all the movies that a user has created.
- Implement a form to add a new movie or edit an existing one. (Fields to keep: Name, Director and a poster image of the movie)
- Each list item should have a delete icon to remove that movie from the list and an edit icon to allow edit on that movie.
- Store the data in either hive or sqflite local database.
